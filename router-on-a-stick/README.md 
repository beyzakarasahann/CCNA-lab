# Router-on-a-Stick (Inter-VLAN Routing) – Packet Tracer

This project shows how to let devices in different VLANs communicate by using **Router-on-a-Stick**.  
A single router interface is divided into sub-interfaces, each assigned to a VLAN.

## 📌 What This Lab Teaches
- How to create VLANs  
- How to assign switch ports to VLANs  
- How to configure a trunk port  
- How to create router sub-interfaces (dot1Q)  
- How different VLANs communicate through a router  

---

## 📁 Device Configurations
All configs are in the **configs/** folder:

- `switch.txt` — VLANs, access ports, trunk  
- `router.txt` — Router-on-a-Stick (sub-interfaces)  
- `pcs.txt` — PC IP addresses + test results

## 🖥️ IP Scheme

**VLAN 10 (192.168.10.0/24)**  
PC0 → 192.168.10.2  
PC1 → 192.168.10.3  
Gateway → 192.168.10.1  

**VLAN 20 (192.168.20.0/24)**  
PC2 → 192.168.20.2  
PC3 → 192.168.20.3  
Gateway → 192.168.20.1

## 🧪 Test Results
✔ Same-VLAN communication works  
✔ Inter-VLAN communication works (Router-on-a-Stick)
